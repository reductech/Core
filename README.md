## Introduction

Reductech makes tools to help you with your e-discovery workflows.<br>
It does this by using *connectors*, each of which connects to an individual piece of third party software.<br><br>

If you want to use existing connectors, see [EDR](https://gitlab.com/reductech/edr/edr)<br>
To create your own connector, see the [Developer Guide](DeveloperGuide.md)<br>
